Imagine an app that helps you manage job applications.

Create a redux app that manages three pieces of state for your job applications app:

contacts - names of people you've met at meetups, etc.
jobs - names of job positions you're applying for
isFormVisible - whether your input form on your (imaginary page) is showing
No need to create any UI - just work as if your redux code will be used in a larger application.

 

Create reducer functions to manage each piece of state separately.

Use the combineReducers function to create a single rootReducer that you can pass to createStore()
